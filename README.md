### This project includes a custom backend built with Express and a frontend developed using React. Below are details on how to start both servers.

### Backend (Express)
The backend files are located in the folder: 1-actual-backend
To start the backend server:
Open a terminal.
Navigate to the backend folder:
cd 1-actual-backend
Run the following command to start the server:
npm start

### Frontend (React)
The frontend (Myntra clone) files are located in the folder: 2-myntra-react-clone
To start the frontend development server:
Open a terminal.
Navigate to the frontend folder:
cd 2-myntra-react-clone
Run the following command to start the frontend:
npm run dev

### Improvements:
Headings and Structure: I added headings for clarity and a structured flow, so it's easier to understand where each component lives and how to start it.
Code Block Formatting: Using code blocks for commands helps readers easily identify the steps.
Brevity and Clarity: The language is kept simple and direct while making it more engaging.

### Built With:
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Frontend**: React, Vite
- **Styling**: CSS
